                <h4>The Lord&#39;s Resistance Army (LRA) in Northern Uganda</h4>
                <p>
                Ethnic tensions and regional disparities play significant roles in the protracted conflict that has plagued northern Uganda for the last several decades.  The country&#39;s divide dates back to the pre-colonial era, but it was exacerbated under British occupation – as the imperial power aggressively invested in infrastructure and spurred economic development in the south, which was largely enjoyed by a single Ugandan ethnic group, the Baganda. Meanwhile, the British stripped northern territories (and the local Acholi ethnic communities) of their natural resources.  
                </br>
                </br>
                In 1986, an armed rebellion launched by Yoweri Museveni&#39;s National Resistance Army (NRA) secured Uganda&#39;s political independence from the British. However, the NRA, largely supported by Baganda militants from the south, then turned their attention to ethnic minorities in the north. The ensuing violence would catalyze the growth of a number of rebel movements – including the Lord&#39;s Resistance Army (LRA), led by Joseph Kony, and the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), led by Jamil Mukulu.  
                </br>
                </br>
                Kony&#39;s rebel faction, in particular, quickly turned to extremism, utilizing forced recruitment through abductions and pillaging rural civilian populations. Violence further escalated in the mid-1990s, when the government of Sudan – looking to counter an effort launched by Ugandan leaders to aid growing insurgent groups in what is now South Sudan – offered military support to the LRA.  In the months and years to follow, the rebel group would launch a series of brutal mass killing campaigns; the most notable episodes include the Atiak massacre, where the LRA summarily executed some 300 men, and the kidnapping of 139 schoolgirls from Aboke in 1996. 
                </br>
                </br>
                Despite years of this manner of indiscriminate violence, in January 2000, the Ugandan Parliament moved to adopt a sweeping general amnesty policy for any individual who was currently or previously engaged in armed hostilities.  The government proceeded to match this reconciliation effort with an aggressive military offensive (code-named Operation Iron Fist) led by the NRA – then renamed Uganda People&#39;s Defense Force (UPDF) – against LRA bases in southern Sudan.  In short, political leaders sought to promote peace through a basic carrot-stick messaging system. While the UPDF (later joined by the armed forces of South Sudan, the DR Congo, and the U.S.) swept through the countryside, ruthlessly destroying LRA camps and hunting for Joseph Kony, the country&#39;s Amnesty Act continued to actively encourage insurgent defections through a flexible, dynamic regime of radio transmissions, pamphlet airdrops, and helicopter loudspeaker broadcasts. 
                </br>
                </br>
                In the first two years the reconciliation project was active, an estimated 16,193 active insurgents and insurgent collaborators gave up their arms and resettled into normal civilian life – a number that constituted approximately 105% of the Ugandan government&#39;s disengagement target.  Remnants of the LRA have continued to operate throughout the DR Congo, South Sudan, and the Central African Republic, but the insurgency has repeated failed to restore its former strongholds in northern Uganda since 2006. 
                </br>
                </br>
                It&#39;s important to reiterate a number of similarities inherent to both Nigeria&#39;s quagmire of violent extremism and Uganda&#39;s history with the Lord&#39;s Resistance Army. Ethnic and regional tensions sit centerstage in both conflicts. Likewise, sparse internet penetration, low literacy rates, and the forced recruitment methods of each country&#39;s respective extremist groups suggest that any policy-centered reassessment of Boko Haram should include a thorough understanding of counter-messaging and counter-insurgency strategies in Uganda.
