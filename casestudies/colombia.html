          <h4>The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC)</h4>
            The Colombian government&#39;s struggle against FARC stands as the single longest running war in the Western hemisphere, meaning significantly more literature and data exists to document both the successful and misguided disengagement programs exercised over the course of the conflict. In 1964, following a decade of large scale political violence,  Manuel Marulanda, a farmer belonging to the Colombian Communist Party, allied with Jacobo Arenas, a Marxist revolutionary, to form Las Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarios de Colombia, a guerrilla movement intent upon resisting the Colombian government and establishing its own sovereign territories in the state&#39;s backcountry.   The insurgency was initially little more than a collection of communist sympathizers and peasant self-defense groups, but it quickly turned to violent extremism, electing to employ a combination of political kidnappings and drug trafficking to fund its operations. The two practices (alongside a liberal system of provisioned social services to loyal rural communities) facilitated the rebel group&#39;s rapid growth throughout the 1980s. 
            </br>
            </br>
            After years of drawn out guerilla conflict, in 2002, then-president Álvaro Uribe Vélez launched the Programa de Atención Humanitaria al Desmovilizado (Program for Humanitarian Attention to the Demobilized) or PAHD. The initiative sought to &#34;induce the renunciation and surrender of members of illegal armed groups, to weaken and demoralize those groups, and to offer social reintegration for those who voluntarily leave the conflict and participate in the program.  
            </br>
            </br>
            Subsequent demobilization campaigns have been tremendously successful. In 2010, the Colombian officials launched Operation Christmas after discovering more guerillas disproportionately chose to defect during the month of December. Government agents &#34;strung motion-detecting Christmas lights on trees along strategic paths in heavily FARC-dominated areas. In an effort to exploit FARC members&#39; feelings of nostalgia during Christmas, signs were placed on each tree that read, &#39;If Christmas can come to the jungle, you too can come home. Demobilize. At Christmas, everything is possible.&#39;&#34;   This resulted in 30 percent increase in active defections compared to the prior holiday season. Additional counter messaging programs made use of &#34;nationally televised commercials that aired during soccer games and flights over FARC controlled areas where pilots would release dozens of state-sponsored soccer balls – painted over with messages that promoted disengagement.&#34;  According to the Colombian government, this campaign directly led to 588 militant desertions.

            </br>
            Most critically, for more than a decade now, the Colombian government has systematically debriefed VE defectors, creating a database of some 15,000 digitized interview transcripts.  A research team led by William Rosenau, a Senior Analyst at the Center for Strategic Studies in Alexandria, Virginia, was granted temporary access to select portions of the database in 2011 and late publish a catalogue of his findings:  
            Interestingly, those demobilized fighters who willingly gave up their arms and sought to reintegrate into civil society overwhelmingly did so because of hardships encountered during their time with FARC – these varied from hunger, extreme fatigue, physical abuse by commanders, and simply the &#34;restless nature&#34; of the government&#39;s counterinsurgency campaign. 
            </br>
            </br>
            If anything, this case study underscores the importance of recognizing the necessity in prioritizing disengagement policies. Rosenau&#39;s team, along with researchers who gained access to the data before them, note that more than a few former fighters refused to renounce FARC&#39;s extremist ideology and violent actions.  It&#39;s important to reiterate, disengaged combatants are not necessarily de-radicalized. However, what&#39;s most critical –and  highlighted in this example – is  removing active militants from the battlefield so they may at the very least make an attempt at the reintegration process.
