			    <h4>Al-Shabab in Somalia</h4>
              In order to assess Al-Shabaab&#39;s weight in Somalia, it is necessary to examine the conditions under which the organization came into being. In 1991, Siad Barre&#39;s authoritarian government fell apart after continuous futile attempts to break up Somalia&#39;s clan structure and install an economic system of scientific socialism.  As a result, a clan-based form of representation emerged that was seen by many as a legitimate alternative to Western-style forms of government. However, shortly after, the different leaders of the clans engaged in warlordism that, again, brought conflict to the fore. The arising power vacuum was eventually filled by the Islamic Courts Union (ICU), which was based on an alliance of Muslim legal scholars and representatives of the influential al-Itthihad al-Islamiya (AIAI) militant group. Essentially, the ICU was a more organized accumulation of traditional Sharia courts, representing each of the clans and their territories. Paired with powerful business representatives, the ICU formalized a system of sophisticated clan representation centered around interpretations of legal Islam that set out to oust the Somali Transitional Federal Government (TFG). As part of their march towards Mogadishu, the ICU installed a militant youth wing as part of its fighting forces. This came to be the predecessor of Al-Shabaab.  By the end of 2006, however, the ICU was demolished, largely through outside intervention of Ethiopia. While most of the top officials of the ICU went into exile or left the political sphere altogether, Al-Shabaab remained present in Somalia, even though marginalized under the Ethiopia-backed TFG.

              In 2009, Ethiopian forces withdrew from Somalia and left the TFG to its own devices. For Al-Shabaab this signaled the beginning of a systematic insurgency to overthrow the government and to establish an Islamic state based on Wahhabi Islamism. Under the lead of Ahmed Abdi Godane  – a member of the Isaq Clan – the organization launched a military campaign to integrate all historic Somali territories under one banner, within an Islamic state.  This appeal to an inherent Somali nationalism was nothing new, but, in light of the trauma of the Ethiopian occupation Al-Shabaab easily persuaded supporters. However, from 2011 onwards, Al-Shabaab has shifted its focus away from nationalist appeals, and towards a full agenda of global Jihadism.

              Given this context and the recent proliferation of violent extremist networks, Somali diasporas have been treated to an immense degree of public scrutiny. However, in a recent article, researchers Paul Joosse, Sandra M. Bucerius, and Sara K. Thompson found that in the Canadian Somali diaspora, the most effective and credible counter-messaging came from the within the Somali community itself.  Predicated on a qualitative analysis of more than 100 interviews, the researchers explored sophisticated, intragroup counternarratives with regard to Al-Shabaab. Interestingly, members self-police &#34;notions of &#39;coolness&#39;, &#39;glory&#39; and &#39;religiosity&#39; to mediate their neighbors&#39; perceptions of the terrorist group and enable a self-empowering rejection of its recruitment narratives.&#34;  In the mind of Joosse and his team, &#34;The efficacy of these [messaging strategies] for resilience is three-fold, positioning the recruiters as odious agents, recruits as weak-minded dupes and [peace promoters] as knowledgeable storytellers who can forewarn others against recruitment to al-Shabaab.&#34;  In short, the study asserts often the most compelling counter messaging regimes are those that already exist within a given community.
